***Main file `final_code_DATAA.ino` uses both folders (HX711_Arduino_Library AND final_code_DATAA) in order to work.***

The folder HX711_Arduino_Library needs to be placed in Arduino IDE's Library folder, or needs to be manually downloaded from the Arduino Libraries Manager located within the IDE.
