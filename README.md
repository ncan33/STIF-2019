# DATAA (Data Acquisition Tool for Adaptable Application)
This device measures the amount of force applied during controlled injury on mice. The device is used for data collection at a research lab in University of Rochester Medical Center. The CAD files for the 3D printed parts can be edited to achieve applicability for various surgery methods.

The strain of an aluminum beam inside the device is measured with two strain gauges. Arduino was used to utilize these strain gauges.

## Design Needs


## Limitations and Future Improvements
***Limitations:***

***Future Improvements:***
- easier adjustability
- full bridge strain gauge
- higher accuracy
- improve grip
- improved portability by removing the necessity of a computer


this thing is low cost
