***Skills Needed:***
* Ability to solder
* Ability to operate a 3D printer and slicer software
* Knowledge of basic circuits
* Basic knowledge of Arduino IDE software

## Manufacturing Process
After the materials and electronic parts are acquired, there are two manufacturing procedures: (1) 3D print the [cad_files](https://github.com/ncan33/DATAA-2019/tree/master/cad_files), (2) solder the [circuit](https://github.com/ncan33/DATAA-2019/tree/master/circuit).

After the circuit is soldered, protect the brittle load cell wires with heat-shrink tubes (optional).

## Assembly Process
1. Fasten `part3.stl` to the load cell using two M3x8 bolt and nut
2. Fasten `part1.stl` and `part2.stl` to the load cell using four M2x12 bolt and nut

Diagrams aren't included because it's extremely easy to assemble this device. Use the [visuals folder](https://github.com/ncan33/DATAA-2019/tree/master/visuals) as a guide during the assembly.
